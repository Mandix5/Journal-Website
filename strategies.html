			<p><b>What is bullying?</b> <br>
			Bullying is when someone purposely causes phyiscal or emotional harm towards someone else. Bullying doesn't just occur at school, it can happen at home, work, online or
			on the playground. Bullies tend to look for someone weaker than them or someone they can easily control. <br>
			<b>Why people bully?</b> <br>
			People bully for many different reasons for example not getting enough attention at home, being bullied themselves, or just feeling the need for dominance and control. 
			They see weaker people as their target and don't accept the consequences for their actions. <br>
			<b>There are different types of bullies:</b> <br>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li> Bullied Bullies- Like to feel dominant over other and bully so they dont feel helpless. </li>
				<li> Social Bullies- Have low self-esteem and use rumors to control people. </li>
				<li> Detached Bullies- Plan out their attacks usually everyone likes them but the person they are bullying.</li>
				<li> Hyperactive Bullies- They do not understamd how to socialize and sometimes acts out physically and inappropriately.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
			<br> Most bullies don't understand how their actions affects the person they are bullying. All these types bullies have not learned compassion and love.
			<br> When kids where asked why they bully these were their responses:
			<br> </p>
			<ul> 
				<li> "Because I'm bullied at home"</li>
				<li> "Because I see other people doing it"</li>
				<li> "So I don't get bullied" </li>
			<p>
			<br> No matter the reason for bullying it is wrong, mean and it should be stopped.
			</ul>

			<p> <b>Ways to deal with a bully</b>
			<br> <ul>
			<li> Always remember you are not alone. No matter what you think there is always someone you can go to, wether it's a parent or a chatline.</li>
			<li> If you feel comfortable with confronting your bully, do so but be careful to not become a bully yourself. Keep your composure and express how you feel. If this does not
			 work,then tell an adult.</li>
			 <li> If you are not comfortable with confronting a bully find an adult you trust and tell them whats been happening. Most times this will help your situation.</li>
			 <li> If the situation escalates and you feel as if there is no hope and want to harm your self call the suicide prevention line.</li>
			</p>
			</ul>
			
			<p><b>What to do if you're a bystander:</b></p>
			<ul>
			
			<p>
			<li> Do not pretend as if nothing is happening. Get the person help or stnd up to the bullly yourself. Watching someone be bulied is not helping the persons situation.
			The bully will feel as if they can do whatever they want because no one will stand up tp them.</li>
