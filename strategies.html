			<p><b>What is bullying?</b> <br>
			Bullying is when someone purposely causes phyiscal or emotional harm towards someone else. Bullying doesn't just occur at school, it can happen at home, work, online or
			on the playground. Bullies tend to look for someone weaker than them or someone they can easily control. <br>
			<b>Why people bully?</b> <br>
			People bully for many different reasons for example not getting enough attention at home, being bullied themselves, or just feeling the need for dominance and control. 
			They see weaker people as their target and don't accept the consequences for their actions. <br>
			<b>There are different types of bullies:</b> <br>
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li> Bullied Bullies- Like to feel dominant over other and bully so they dont feel helpless. </li>
				<li> Social Bullies- Have low self-esteem and use rumors to control people. </li>
				<li> Detached Bullies- Plan out their attacks usually everyone likes them but the person they are bullying.</li>
				<li> Hyperactive Bullies- They do not understamd how to socialize and sometimes acts out physically and inappropriately.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
			<br> Most bullies don't understand how their actions affects the person they are bullying. All these types bullies have not learned compassion and love.
			<br> When kids where asked why they bully these were their responses:
			<br> </p>
			<ul> 
				<li> "Because I'm bullied at home"</li>
				<li> "Because I see other people doing it"</li>
				<li> "So I don't get bullied" </li>
			</ul>
			<p>
			<br> No matter the reason for bullying it is wrong, mean and it should be stopped.
