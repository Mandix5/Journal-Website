		<p>We are just a pair of teenagers trying to make a difference.
		This website was created to make sure no one feels alone. We want
		everyone who clicks on this website to feel welcome and to feel joy.
		Someone once said "A good laugh heals a lot of hurt". This quote to
		us is important to knowingthat you are not alone in anything that you
		do. Know one should ever feel like they are so different and that
		everyone else is more important than they are. No one is more important
		than you, no one should have any say in who you are or what you like to
		do. You have as much of a voice as any other person in this world, you
		have a choice. If you are being bullied you can either let them have
		control over you or you could not listen to them. Bullying is something
		that should not be just shrugged off and you should come at it with
		full force. We want to really just help those who feel like the
		outsider. Those who feel way to different and feel held back by society
		to do the things that they want to do. We may just be a pair of
		teenagers but we want people to be happy in their own skin.
